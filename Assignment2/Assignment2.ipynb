        "- The datasets are those that were given with the task: bigrams.txt and coca_all_links.txt.\n",
        "- When working with probabilities, I used logarythms to avoid products of small float numbers. The technique is taken from one of the sources I was inspired by when writing.\n",
        "- In general, training is the computation of probability of every word in dictionary to appear in different contexts.\n",
        "- When model is asked to correct the word, it finds the new word (by iterating the whole dictionary) that is close (in terms of [edit distance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/edit-distance-dp-5/) that should be <=2) and has the highest probability of being the correct word given context (word before and after)\n",
        "- Iterating over the whole dictionary to find close words is much better than iterating over all corrections of the word, since there are ~65k words in dictionary, while the word of even 6 symbols has >100k different misspelings.\n",
        "- In case when context is not given or unknown, model gives higher probability to word that appears more frequently in the corpus.\n",
